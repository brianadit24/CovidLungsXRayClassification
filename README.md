# Classification of Covid on X-ray of Lungs with Transfer Learning

## Introduction
This is Machine Learning Notebook Research to Classify Covid on X-ray of Lungs with Multiple Transfer Learning Architecture.<br>
<b>This Research Funded by HIT (Hibah Integrasi Tridharma).</b>

## Workflows to Build Model
1. Collect Data on External Sources
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Augmentation
4. Build an Custom Architecture for Multiple Transfer Learning Architecture
5. Training with Freeze Model
6. Continue Training with UnFreeze Model (Fine Tuning)
7. Saved and Evaluate The Model
8. A/B Testing (Compare Model)

## Result
1. <b>Training History:</b>

    Coming Soon

2. <b>Confusion Matrix:</b>
    - Before Fine Tuning:

      Coming Soon
    
    - After Fine Tuning:
    
      Coming Soon

3. <b>Evaluate with F1-Score:</b>
    - Before Fine Tuning:

      Coming Soon
    
    - After Fine Tuning:
    
      Coming Soon
